## Answers

- What is HTTPS SSL 2 main roles

The two main roles of HTTPS/SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are authentication and encryption. Authentication verifies that the website you're connecting to is the legitimate site, and not a fake or imposter site. Encryption ensures that any data you send to the website is scrambled so that it can't be read by anyone else. This is important for things like online banking and shopping, where you need to be sure that your personal information is safe.
