## Processing stage
The preprocessing stage is the first step in the C compilation process. It involves processing the source code before actual compilation takes place. In this stage, the C preprocessor performs several tasks, such as removing comments, expanding macros, and processing preprocessor directives. Let's explore the preprocessing stage in detail.

### Tasks Performed in the Preprocessing Stage:

1. **Comment Removal**: The preprocessor removes all comments from the source code. Comments are lines of code that are meant for human readers and are ignored by the compiler.

2. **Macro Expansion**: The preprocessor expands macros defined in the source code. Macros are defined using the `#define` directive and allow you to create shortcuts or parameterized code snippets. When a macro is encountered, the preprocessor replaces it with its corresponding expansion.

3. **File Inclusion**: The preprocessor processes `#include` directives, which are used to include external files into the source code. It retrieves the contents of the included files and inserts them at the specified location.

4. **Conditional Compilation**: The preprocessor handles conditional compilation directives such as `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif`. These directives allow you to selectively include or exclude blocks of code based on predefined conditions.

5. **Symbolic Constants**: The preprocessor replaces symbolic constants defined with `#define` with their corresponding values. Symbolic constants are named values that can be used in place of literals, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

6. **Line Control**: The preprocessor inserts line control information into the code to assist in error reporting and debugging. This information typically includes the original file name and line number.

### Files Received in the Preprocessing Stage:

The preprocessing stage takes the C source code files as input. These files can have various extensions, such as `.c`, `.h`, or others.

### File Output of the Preprocessing Stage:

The output of the preprocessing stage is a preprocessed source code file. By convention, this file usually has the same name as the original source code file but with a `.i` extension (e.g., `main.i`).

### Command to Access Output Files of the Preprocessing Stage:

To generate the preprocessed source code file, you can use the `gcc` command with the `-E` option followed by the input file name and the `-o` option to specify the output file name. Here's an example command:

```shell
gcc -E main.c -o main.i
```

This command runs the preprocessor on the `main.c` file and outputs the preprocessed code to `main.i`.


## Compilation process
The compilation stage is the second step in the C compilation process. In this stage, the preprocessed source code is translated into assembly language instructions specific to the target architecture. The compiler performs syntax checking and basic type checking to ensure the code is valid. Let's explore the compilation stage in detail.

### Tasks Performed in the Compilation Stage:

1. **Syntax Checking**: The compiler analyzes the preprocessed source code for syntax errors. It checks if the code adheres to the rules of the C language, such as proper placement of semicolons, parentheses, and correct syntax for function declarations, variable assignments, and control flow structures.

2. **Semantic Analysis**: The compiler performs basic type checking to ensure that variables, expressions, and function calls are used in a manner consistent with their declared types. It verifies that the operations performed on variables and expressions are valid according to C's type system.

3. **Intermediate Code Generation**: The compiler translates the preprocessed source code into an intermediate representation that is easier to work with than the original code. This intermediate code is often represented as a low-level, platform-independent form, such as three-address code or an abstract syntax tree (AST).

4. **Optimization**: The compiler may apply various optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of the generated code. These optimizations can include eliminating redundant code, reordering instructions for better performance, and simplifying expressions.

5. **Error Reporting**: If any syntax errors or semantic issues are detected, the compiler generates error messages with details about the problems and their locations in the source code. These error messages help developers identify and fix issues in their code.

### Files Received in the Compilation Stage:

The compilation stage takes the preprocessed source code files as input. These files are typically generated in the previous preprocessing stage and have a `.i` extension (e.g., `main.i`).

### File Output of the Compilation Stage:

The output of the compilation stage is an assembly code file. The assembly code is a low-level representation of the program that is specific to the target architecture. By convention, the assembly code file often has a `.s` extension (e.g., `main.s`).

### Command to Access Output Files of the Compilation Stage:

To generate the assembly code file, you can use the `gcc` command with the `-S` option followed by the input file name and the `-o` option to specify the output file name. Here's an example command:

```shell
gcc -S main.i -o main.s
```

This command compiles the preprocessed code in `main.i` and outputs the assembly code to `main.s`.


## Assemble stage
The assembly stage is the third step in the C compilation process. In this stage, the compiler translates the generated assembly code into object code. The object code consists of binary instructions specific to the target architecture and is understandable by the computer's processor. Let's explore the assembly stage in detail.

### Tasks Performed in the Assembly Stage:

1. **Assembly Code Translation**: The assembler translates the assembly code, which is written using human-readable mnemonics, into machine code instructions. Each assembly instruction corresponds to a specific operation that the processor can execute.

2. **Symbol Resolution**: The assembler resolves references to symbols, such as function names and global variables, used in the assembly code. It associates these symbols with their respective memory addresses or offsets.

3. **Relocation**: The assembler performs relocation, which involves adjusting memory addresses or offsets in the assembly code to reflect the final memory layout of the program. This ensures that the code can be loaded and executed correctly.

4. **Object Code Generation**: The assembler generates the object code, which is a binary representation of the assembly code. The object code consists of machine instructions, data sections, symbol tables, and relocation information.

### Files Received in the Assembly Stage:

The assembly stage takes the assembly code files as input. These files are typically generated in the previous compilation stage and have a `.s` extension (e.g., `main.s`).

### File Output of the Assembly Stage:

The output of the assembly stage is an object code file. The object code file contains the translated machine instructions and associated data. By convention, the object code file often has a `.o` extension (e.g., `main.o`).

### Command to Access Output Files of the Assembly Stage:

To generate the object code file, you can use the `gcc` command with the `-c` option followed by the input file name and the `-o` option to specify the output file name. Here's an example command:

```shell
gcc -c main.s -o main.o
```

This command assembles the code in `main.s` and outputs the object code to `main.o`.

## Linking stage
The linking stage is the final step in the C compilation process. In this stage, the linker combines multiple object code files, along with necessary system libraries, to create an executable file. The linker resolves references to external symbols, performs symbol table management, and prepares the final executable. Let's explore the linking stage in detail.

### Tasks Performed in the Linking Stage:

1. **Symbol Resolution**: The linker resolves references to external symbols used across multiple object code files. It searches for the definitions of these symbols and associates them with their corresponding memory addresses or offsets. This process ensures that all symbol references are correctly linked.

2. **Symbol Table Management**: The linker manages a symbol table, which is a data structure that keeps track of symbols used in the program. It maintains information about symbol names, their memory locations, and other attributes. The linker updates and merges symbol tables from different object files during the linking process.

3. **Library and Object File Combination**: The linker combines object code files generated from individual source code files, along with any required system libraries, to create a single executable file. It resolves dependencies between different object files and libraries, ensuring that all required code and resources are included in the final executable.

4. **Relocation**: The linker performs final relocation, adjusting memory addresses or offsets in the object code to reflect the actual memory layout of the executable. It ensures that all references and instructions are correctly aligned and can be loaded and executed as intended.

5. **Executable File Generation**: The linker generates the final executable file. This file contains the machine code, data sections, symbol tables, relocation information, and other necessary metadata. The executable file is ready to be executed by the operating system.

### Files Received in the Linking Stage:

The linking stage takes multiple object code files as input. These files are generated in the previous assembly stage and have a `.o` extension (e.g., `main.o`, `functions.o`).

### File Output of the Linking Stage:

The output of the linking stage is an executable file. The executable file is the final result of the compilation process, containing the complete program ready to be executed. The file may have a name specified by the user or by default, such as `main` or `a.out`.

### Command to Access Output Files of the Linking Stage:

To generate the executable file, you can use the `gcc` command followed by the object code files and any required system libraries. Here's an example command:

```shell
gcc main.o functions.o -o main
```

This command links the object code files `main.o` and `functions.o` together and creates the executable file `main`.
