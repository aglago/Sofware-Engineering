# Binary Representation
Binary Representation:
In the binary (base-2) number system, each digit can have one of two possible values: 0 or 1. A binary number is composed of a series of 0s and 1s, where each digit represents a power of 2.

For example, the binary number 1011012 represents:
(1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45

Converting Decimal to Binary:
To convert a decimal (base-10) number to binary (base-2), you can use the process of successive division by 2. Here's a step-by-step method:

1. Start with the decimal number.
2. Divide the number by 2 and note down the remainder (0 or 1).
3. Keep dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient becomes 0.
4. Read the remainders from bottom to top. This sequence of 0s and 1s is the binary representation of the decimal number.

Example: Convert decimal number 2510 to binary.

```
25 / 2 = 12, remainder 1
12 / 2 = 6, remainder 0
6 / 2 = 3, remainder 0
3 / 2 = 1, remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0, remainder 1
```

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 25 is 110012.

Converting Binary to Decimal:
To convert a binary number to a decimal number, you can use the positional value of each bit in the binary representation.

Example: Convert binary number 110012 to decimal.

```
(1 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 25
```

So, the binary number 110012 represents the decimal number 2510.
