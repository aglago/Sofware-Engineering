# Left Shift Operator, <<
The left shift operator (`<<`) is a bitwise operator that shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. It effectively multiplies the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.

The syntax of the left shift operator is straightforward:

```c
result = num << shift_count;
```

Here, `num` is the operand, and `shift_count` is the number of positions by which the bits will be shifted to the left. The result will hold the value after applying the left shift operation.

Keep in mind that when performing a left shift, the bits shifted out from the left are discarded, and the new bits on the right side are filled with zeros.

Let's see some examples to understand how the left shift operator works in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int num = 10; // Binary: 00001010

    unsigned int result1 = num << 2; // Binary: 00101000
    unsigned int result2 = num << 3; // Binary: 01010000

    printf("num = %u\n", num); // Output: num = 10
    printf("result1 = %u\n", result1); // Output: result1 = 40
    printf("result2 = %u\n", result2); // Output: result2 = 80

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a variable `num` with the value `10` (binary: `00001010`). When we apply a left shift by 2 positions, we get the result `40` (binary: `00101000`). Similarly, a left shift by 3 positions gives us the result `80` (binary: `01010000`).

The left shift operator is commonly used for efficient multiplication and some bitwise manipulation techniques. It is particularly useful when dealing with powers of 2, as multiplying by a power of 2 can be done using left shifts, which are generally faster than traditional multiplication.

## Use Cases of the Left Shift  Operator
### Use Case 1: Efficient Multiplication by Powers of 2
**Explanation**: One of the most common use cases of the left shift operator is for efficient multiplication by powers of 2. Shifting a number to the left by `n` positions is equivalent to multiplying the number by `2^n`.

**Example**:
Let's efficiently multiply the number `num` by `8` (which is 2^3) using the left shift operator.

**Program**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int num = 5; // Binary: 00000101

    unsigned int result = num << 3; // Equivalent to num * 8

    printf("num = %u\n", num); // Output: num = 5
    printf("result = %u\n", result); // Output: result = 40

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
num = 5
result = 40
```

**Visual Representation**:

```
num      : 00000101
result   : 00101000 (40 in decimal)
```

In this example, `num` is initially set to `5` (binary: `00000101`). When we perform a left shift by `3` positions (`num << 3`), we effectively multiply `num` by `2^3` (which is `8`). The result is `40` (binary: `00101000`).

### Use Case 2: Creating Bitmasks

**Explanation**: Left shift is commonly used to create bitmasks for setting or clearing specific bits in an integer.

**Example**:
Suppose we want to create a bitmask with the 3rd bit set to `1` and all other bits set to `0`.

**Program**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int bitmask = 1 << 2; // Shift 1 left by 2 positions

    printf("bitmask = %u\n", bitmask); // Output: bitmask = 4

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
bitmask = 4
```

**Visual Representation**:

```
bitmask  : 00000100 (4 in decimal)
```

In this example, we shift the value `1` left by `2` positions using the left shift operator (`1 << 2`). This creates a bitmask where only the 3rd bit is set to `1`, and all other bits are set to `0`. The result is `4` (binary: `00000100`).

### Use Case 3: Packing Multiple Values

**Explanation**: The left shift operator can be used to pack multiple values into a single integer variable.

**Example**:
Suppose we have three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, each representing 4-bit values. We want to pack these three values into a single 12-bit integer variable `packed` with `a` as the most significant 4 bits, `b` as the next 4 bits, and `c` as the least significant 4 bits.

**Program**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int a = 7; // Binary: 0111
    unsigned int b = 3; // Binary: 0011
    unsigned int c = 5; // Binary: 0101

    unsigned int packed = (a << 8) | (b << 4) | c; // Combine the values

    printf("a = %u, b = %u, c = %u\n", a, b, c); // Output: a = 7, b = 3, c = 5
    printf("packed = %u\n", packed); // Output: packed = 189

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
a = 7, b = 3, c = 5
packed = 189
```

**Visual Representation**:

```
a        : 0111
b        : 0011
c        : 0101
packed   : 011100110101 (189 in decimal)
```

In this example, we have three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, each representing 4-bit values. By shifting `a` left by `8` positions, `b` left by `4` positions, and then combining the values using the bitwise OR (`|`) operator, we create a single integer `packed` with the packed values. The result is `189` (binary: `011100110101`).

These are just a few use cases of the left shift operator in C. The left shift is versatile and commonly used in low-level programming for various bitwise operations, bit manipulation, and packing multiple values into a single integer.
