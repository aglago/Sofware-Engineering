# Bitwise NOT,~ Operator
The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) is a unary operator in C that performs the bitwise complement of a single operand. It flips all the bits of the operand, changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

The syntax of the bitwise NOT operator is simple:

```c
result = ~num;
```

Here, `num` is the operand, and `result` will hold the value after applying the bitwise NOT operation.

Let's see some examples to understand how the bitwise NOT operator works in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int num = 10; // Binary: 00001010

    unsigned int result = ~num; // Binary: 11110101

    printf("num = %u\n", num); // Output: num = 10
    printf("result = %u\n", result); // Output: result = 245

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a variable `num` with the value `10` (binary: `00001010`). When we apply the bitwise NOT operation to `num`, we get the result `245` (binary: `11110101`).

Note that the result of the bitwise NOT operation is an unsigned integer with all bits flipped. In C, the data type `unsigned int` is used to ensure that the sign bit is not propagated during the operation.

Keep in mind that the number of bits considered for the NOT operation depends on the size of the data type. For example, if `num` is of type `unsigned char`, only 8 bits will be flipped. If it is of type `unsigned int`, 32 or 64 bits will be flipped depending on the platform.

You can use the bitwise NOT operator in various scenarios, such as bit toggling, bitmasking, and complementing bits in bitwise operations.

## Use Cases of NOT Operator
### Use Case 1: Bit Toggling

**Explanation**: Bit toggling means changing the state of individual bits in a binary number from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

**Example**:
Suppose we want to toggle the 3rd bit of the binary number `num`, which is `00101011` (43 in decimal). We can use the bitwise NOT operator to create a bitmask with the 3rd bit set to 1 and all other bits set to 0. Then, by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the original number and the bitmask, we can toggle the 3rd bit.

**Program**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int num = 43; // Binary: 00101011

    unsigned int bitmask = 1 << 2; // Binary: 00000100
    unsigned int result = num ^ bitmask;

    printf("num = %u\n", num); // Output: num = 43
    printf("result = %u\n", result); // Output: result = 47

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
num = 43
result = 47
```

**Visual Representation**:

```
num      : 00101011
bitmask  : 00000100
result   : 00101111 (47 in decimal)
```

### Use Case 2: Complementing Bits

**Explanation**: Complementing bits means changing all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s in a binary number.

**Example**:
Let's complement all bits of the binary number `num`, which is `10100100` (164 in decimal), using the bitwise NOT operator.

**Program**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int num = 164; // Binary: 10100100

    unsigned int result = ~num;

    printf("num = %u\n", num); // Output: num = 164
    printf("result = %u\n", result); // Output: result = 91

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
num = 164
result = 91
```

**Visual Representation**:

```
num      : 10100100
result   : 01011011 (91 in decimal)
```

### Use Case 3: Creating Bitmask for Flags

**Explanation**: Bitmasking is a technique used to represent multiple flags or options using individual bits in an integer.

**Example**:
Suppose we want to create a bitmask with the 1st and 3rd bits set to 1 and all other bits set to 0. We can achieve this using the bitwise NOT operator in combination with left shifts.

**Program**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int bitmask = ~(1 << 0 | 1 << 2);

    printf("bitmask = %u\n", bitmask); // Output: bitmask = 5

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:
```
bitmask = 5
```

**Visual Representation**:

```
bitmask  : 00000101 (5 in decimal)
```

These are just a few use cases of the bitwise NOT operator in C. The NOT operator can be used in various scenarios to manipulate individual bits, create bitmasks, and perform other bitwise operations efficiently. Keep practicing and experimenting to enhance your understanding of bitwise operations in C.
