Sure! Let's move on to the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.

**Bitwise XOR (^) Operator:**
The bitwise XOR operator (^) performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation between corresponding bits of two integers. The result will have a 1 in any position where the input bits differ (one bit is 1 and the other is 0). If both input bits are the same (both 0 or both 1), the result will be 0.

The truth table for the XOR operator is as follows:
```
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
```

**Example: Using Bitwise XOR Operator**

Let's consider an example using the XOR operator:

**Example: XORing two numbers**

Let's take two numbers, 10 (1010 in binary) and 6 (0110 in binary), and perform the XOR operation between them.

```
   1010  (Number: 10)
^  0110  (Number: 6)
---------
   1100  (Result: 12)
```

In this example, the bits at positions 1 and 3 are different in the two numbers. The XOR operation results in 1100 (12 in decimal), where the differing bits are set to 1.

## Use Cases of XOR Operator
### Toggling Bits
toggling is setting bit 1 to 0 or bit 0 to 1 without knowing beforehand whether it was initally 0 or 1
+ AND and OR can perform this function of changing bit 1 to 0 or changing bit 0 to 1, but in this case, you have to know whether the bit is 1 before you know that if I AND with 0 it will flip to 0. but if the bit is 0 and I AND with 0, the answer will still be 0 and it would have not flipped.
+ But for XOR, if the bit is 1 and you XOR it with 1 and it will flip to 0. if the bit is 0 and I XOR with 1, it will flip to 1. 
+ that is the power of XOR.

Toggling a bit means changing its state from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 without knowing its initial value beforehand. The operation should have the effect of inverting the bit, regardless of its original state.

This is precisely what the XOR operator does. When you XOR a bit with 1, it will change its state from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, without requiring knowledge of its initial value. That's why the XOR operator is often used for toggling bits.

The truth table for the XOR operator illustrates this behavior:

```
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
```

As you can see, when XORing a bit with 1, the bit will be flipped (toggled) to its opposite state, regardless of whether it was initially 0 or 1. This makes the XOR operator a convenient choice for toggling bits in an integer or a bit sequence.


## Use Case: Swapping Values
The XOR operator can be used to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. This technique takes advantage of the properties of the XOR operator, which allows us to reverse the effect of an XOR operation by performing it again.

**Example: Swapping Values using XOR Operator**

Let's say we have two variables `x` and `y`, both initialized with values:

```
int x = 10; // Binary: 1010
int y = 6;  // Binary: 0110
```

To swap the values of `x` and `y` without using a temporary variable, you can use the XOR operator as follows:

```c
x = x ^ y;
y = x ^ y;
x = x ^ y;
```

Now, let's go through the steps of the swapping process:

1. `x = x ^ y;`
   - `x` becomes `1010 ^ 0110`, which results in `1100` (12 in decimal).
   - `x` is now `1100`.

2. `y = x ^ y;`
   - `y` becomes `1100 ^ 0110`, which results in `1010` (10 in decimal).
   - `y` is now `1010`.

3. `x = x ^ y;`
   - `x` becomes `1100 ^ 1010`, which results in `0110` (6 in decimal).
   - `x` is now `0110`.

After this sequence of operations, the values of `x` and `y` are swapped. Now `x` holds the original value of `y`, and `y` holds the original value of `x`.

**Explanation:**
The trick behind this swapping method lies in the self-cancelling property of the XOR operation. When we XOR a number twice with the same value, it returns the original number. This is due to the way XOR works:

```
x ^ y ^ y = x  // The XOR of y with itself cancels out and leaves us with x
```

By using the XOR operator to perform the swap, we avoid using an additional variable, which can be beneficial in scenarios where memory is constrained or for the sake of optimization.
  
**C program to demonstrate values swapping with XOR**  
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    
    printf("Before swapping\n");
    printf("a: %d\nb: %d\n", a, b);
    
    a = a ^ b;
    b = a ^ b;
    a = a ^ b;
    
    printf("After swapping\n");
    printf("a: %d\nb: %d\n", a, b);
    

    return 0;
}
```

output: 
```
Before swapping
a: 1
b: 2
After swapping
a: 2
b: 1
```

Sure, let's move on to the next use case of the XOR operator.

**Use Case: Finding the Odd Occurring Element in an Array**

The XOR operator can be used to find the element that occurs an odd number of times in an array. This is an interesting application of XOR and takes advantage of its self-cancelling property when applied to duplicate elements.

**Example: Finding the Odd Occurring Element**

Suppose we have the following array of integers: `[2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 8, 6, 10, 8]`.

To find the element that occurs an odd number of times in the array, you can perform the XOR operation on all the elements in the array. The duplicate elements will cancel each other out, leaving only the element that occurs an odd number of times.

Let's go through the steps of finding the odd occurring element:

```c
int arr[] = {2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 8, 6, 10, 8};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

int oddOccurringElement = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    oddOccurringElement ^= arr[i];
}
```

After performing the XOR operation on all the elements of the array, `oddOccurringElement` will hold the value of the element that occurs an odd number of times.

**Explanation:**
When XORing duplicate elements, they cancel each other out because XORing a number twice with the same value results in the original number. For example:

```
2 ^ 2 = 0
4 ^ 4 = 0
6 ^ 6 = 0
8 ^ 8 = 0
```

Since all the duplicate elements cancel out, the XOR operation on the entire array reduces to:

```c
oddOccurringElement = 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 10;
```

Since `0 ^ 0` is 0, the XOR operation simplifies to:

```c
oddOccurringElement = 0 ^ 10;
```

Finally, `0 ^ 10` results in `10`, which is the odd occurring element in the array.

This technique works because the XOR operator is commutative and associative. It allows us to efficiently find the element that occurs an odd number of times in the array without using any additional data structures or nested loops.

### C program to demonstrate this
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 8, 6, 10, 8};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int i = 0, odd_occurring_num;
    
    for (; i < n; i++)
        odd_occurring_num ^= arr[i];
    printf("odd occurring number is %d.", odd_occurring_num);
    

    return 0;
}
```

### output
```c
odd occurring number is 10.
```

## Use Case 3: Detecting Duplicates in an Array**
The XOR operator can be used to detect duplicates in an array, where all elements appear an even number of times except for one element, which appears an odd number of times. This technique is similar to the previous use case, but it helps us identify the unique element in an array with duplicate elements.

**Example: Detecting Duplicates in an Array**

Suppose we have the following array of integers with duplicates: `[3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 6]`.

To find the element that appears an odd number of times (i.e., the unique element), you can perform the XOR operation on all the elements in the array. The duplicate elements will cancel each other out, and the XOR result will be the unique element.

Let's go through the steps of finding the unique element:

```c
int arr[] = {3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 6};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

int uniqueElement = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    uniqueElement ^= arr[i];
}
```

After performing the XOR operation on all the elements of the array, `uniqueElement` will hold the value of the unique element.

**Explanation:**
When XORing duplicate elements, they cancel each other out because XORing a number twice with the same value results in the original number. For example:

```
3 ^ 3 = 0
4 ^ 4 = 0
2 ^ 2 = 0
6 ^ 6 = 0
```

Since all the duplicate elements cancel out, the XOR operation on the entire array reduces to:

```c
uniqueElement = 0 ^ 5;
```

Finally, `0 ^ 5` results in `5`, which is the unique element in the array.

This technique works because XORing elements with their duplicates eliminates the duplicates and leaves the unique element as the result of the XOR operation. It's an efficient way to identify the unique element in an array with duplicate elements, and it has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
i

### C program to demonstrate
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 6};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int i = 0, unique_element;
    
    for (; i < n; i++)
        unique_element ^= arr[i];
    printf("Unique element is %d.", unique_element);
    

    return 0;
}
```

## Use Case: Finding the Missing Number in an Array
The XOR operator can be used to find the missing number in an array of integers, where all elements from 1 to n (inclusive) are present in the array except for one number. This technique is based on XORing the array elements and XORing the numbers from 1 to n. The missing number will be the XOR result of these two XOR operations.

**Example: Finding the Missing Number in an Array**

Suppose we have the following array of integers with one missing number: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]`. The array should contain all numbers from 1 to 8 (inclusive), but the number 5 is missing.

To find the missing number in the array, you can perform the XOR operation on both the array elements and the numbers from 1 to n (in this case, n = 8). The missing number will be the XOR result of these two XOR operations.

Let's go through the steps of finding the missing number:

```c
int arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

// XOR of array elements
int xorArray = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    xorArray ^= arr[i];
}

// XOR of numbers from 1 to n
int xorNumbers = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++) {
    xorNumbers ^= i;
}

// Finding the missing number
int missingNumber = xorArray ^ xorNumbers;
```

After performing the XOR operations, `missingNumber` will hold the value of the missing number (in this case, 5).

**Explanation:**
The missing number can be found by XORing all the elements in the array and XORing all the numbers from 1 to n. Since XORing a number with itself results in 0, all the common numbers between the array elements and the numbers from 1 to n will cancel each other out, leaving only the missing number in the result.

```
XOR of array elements: 1 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 3 ^ 7 ^ 8 = 13
1 ^ 2 = 3
3 ^ 4 = 7
7 ^ 6 = 1
1 ^ 3 = 2
2 ^ 7 = 5
5 ^ 8 = 13

XOR of numbers from 1 to n: 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6 ^ 7 ^ 8 = 8
1 ^ 2 = 3
3 ^ 3 = 0
0 ^ 4 = 4
4 ^ 5 = 1
1 ^ 6 = 7
7 ^ 7 = 0
0 ^ 8 = 8
```

Finally, `missingNumber = 13 ^ 8`, and `13 ^ 8` results in `5`, which is the missing number in the array.

This technique is a clever and efficient way to find the missing number in an array with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### C Program to demonstrate
```c
// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
int arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8};
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

// XOR of array elements
int xorArray = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    xorArray ^= arr[i];
}
printf("Result of XORing elements in array was: %d.\n", xorArray);

// XOR of numbers from 1 to n
int xorNumbers = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++) {
    xorNumbers ^= i;
}
printf("Result of XORing numbers 1 to 8 was: %d.\n", xorNumbers);

printf("xorArray ^ xorNumbers is: %d\n", xorArray ^ xorNumbers);
printf("13 ^ 8 is: %d\n", 13 ^ 8);

// Finding the missing number
int missingNumber = xorArray ^ xorNumbers;

printf("Missing number is: %d.\n", missingNumber);

int miss = 1 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6;
printf("Miss: %d\n", miss);

    

    return 0;
}
```
### output
```
Result of XORing elements in array was: 13.
Result of XORing numbers 1 to 8 was: 8.
xorArray ^ xorNumbers is: 5
13 ^ 8 is: 5
Missing number is: 5.
Miss: 4
