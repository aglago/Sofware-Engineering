# Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation refers to the process of manipulating individual bits in a binary representation of data. In computing, data is often represented using binary digits (bits), which can have a value of 0 or 1. Bit manipulation allows programmers to perform various operations on these individual bits to achieve specific tasks efficiently.

Bit manipulation is commonly used in low-level programming, system programming, and embedded systems, where direct control over hardware and memory is required. It is also useful in tasks that involve optimizing memory usage, encoding data compactly, or performing specific operations at the bit level.

The fundamental operations in bit manipulation are performed using bitwise operators:

1. AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on two operands, setting each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1; otherwise, it sets the bit to 0.

2. OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation on two operands, setting each bit to 1 if at least one corresponding bit is 1.

3. XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on two operands, setting each bit to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1; otherwise, it sets the bit to 0.

4. NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single operand, flipping all the bits, i.e., changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

5. Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits of a binary number to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.

6. Right shift (>>): Shifts the bits of a binary number to the right by a specified number of positions, effectively dividing the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift count.

These bitwise operations can be used to manipulate specific bits within integers, pack multiple boolean flags into a single integer, perform arithmetic operations in an optimized manner, and solve various algorithmic problems efficiently.

Bit manipulation requires a clear understanding of binary representation and logical operations. While it is often used in low-level programming, it can also be useful in high-level programming languages for certain tasks that involve bit-level operations.

# Binary Representation
Binary Representation:
In the binary (base-2) number system, each digit can have one of two possible values: 0 or 1. A binary number is composed of a series of 0s and 1s, where each digit represents a power of 2.

For example, the binary number 1011012 represents:
(1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45

Converting Decimal to Binary:
To convert a decimal (base-10) number to binary (base-2), you can use the process of successive division by 2. Here's a step-by-step method:

1. Start with the decimal number.
2. Divide the number by 2 and note down the remainder (0 or 1).
3. Keep dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient becomes 0.
4. Read the remainders from bottom to top. This sequence of 0s and 1s is the binary representation of the decimal number.

Example: Convert decimal number 2510 to binary.

```
25 / 2 = 12, remainder 1
12 / 2 = 6, remainder 0
6 / 2 = 3, remainder 0
3 / 2 = 1, remainder 1
1 / 2 = 0, remainder 1
```

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 25 is 110012.

Converting Binary to Decimal:
To convert a binary number to a decimal number, you can use the positional value of each bit in the binary representation.

Example: Convert binary number 110012 to decimal.

```
(1 * 2^4) + (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 25
```

So, the binary number 110012 represents the decimal number 2510.
