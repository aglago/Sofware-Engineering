# Bitwise Operator AND, &
The AND (&) operator performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands. It operates on the individual bits of the binary representation of both operands and sets the corresponding bit in the result to 1 only if both bits are 1; otherwise, it sets the bit to 0.

The truth table for the AND operator is as follows:

```
0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1
```

Here's how the AND operation works for each bit position:

```
   1 0 1 0  (binary: A)
 & 1 1 0 1  (binary: B)
---------
   1 0 0 0  (binary: Result)
```

Example: Let's perform the bitwise AND operation between two decimal numbers, 10 and 13:

```
   10 (decimal: A)
 & 13 (decimal: B)
---------
   8  (decimal: Result)
```

The binary representation of 10 is 1010, and the binary representation of 13 is 1101. The bitwise AND operation results in 1000, which is the binary representation of the decimal number 8.

You can also use the AND operator to perform specific bit manipulations, such as extracting specific bits, checking if a particular bit is set, or masking certain bits in an integer.

# Use Cases of AND operator
The AND bitwise operator can be used to perform various bit manipulations, and it plays a crucial role in low-level programming and certain algorithmic optimizations. Here are some common applications of the AND operator:

## AND is used for Clearing Bits
+ Clearing a bit means setting it to `0` while leaving other bits unchanged.
+ **How do we achieve this ?**
+ looking at the AND logic table, anytime we pair any bit operand with `0`, the result is `0`.
+ so if we AND any operand with `0`, we end up clearing it since the result will be `0`
+ for that matter, we create a mask which will be ANDed with the operand in order for it to be cleared.

### How To Create a Mask
A mask is created by putting 0 at the all the positions you want to clear and 1 at all other positions. **forexample**: if I have a binary numbe 101, and I want to clear the bit at the 3rd position (always count from right to left), that is 1, the bitmask I will create will have `0` at the position I want to clear and `1` at all other positions.  
  
- Original Number: 101
- Mask: 011
- Results: 001
this way, after ANDing the number, we clear the position at 3.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Example 1: Clear the 3rd bit (0-based index) of the number 13 (1101 in binary).**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with 0 at the 3rd bit position (counting from 0), and 1s everywhere else.
```
Bitmask:   1011
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (13) and the bitmask.
```
   1101   (Number: 13)
 & 1011   (Bitmask)
---------
   1001   (Result: 9)
```

Now, the difference between 13 (1101) and the results we got is that, the 3rd bit has been set to 0.


**Example 2: Clear the 2nd and 4th bits of the number 27 (11011 in binary).**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with 0s at the 2nd and 4th bit positions (counting from 0), and 1s everywhere else.
```
Bitmask:   10101
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (27) and the bitmask.
```
   11011  (Number: 27)
 & 10101 (Bitmask)
---------
   10001  (Result: 17)
```

In this example, the 2nd and 4th bits of the number (11011) were cleared, resulting in the number 10001, which is 17 in decimal.

**Test Questions:**

- A. Clear the 5th bit (0-based index) of the number 42 (101010 in binary).
- B. Clear the 0th and 3rd bits of the number 123 (1111011 in binary).


## AND is used for checking if a bit is set
- If a bit it set, then its value is 1, else, its value is 0.
- In order to verify if a bit is 1, we can use that bit with & 1.
- if the bit & 1 results to 1, then that bit is 1, since `1 & 1 == 1`
  
**Example: Check if the 4th bit (0-based index) of the number 27 (11011 in binary) is set.**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with only the 4th bit set to 1 (and all other bits set to 0).
```
Bitmask:   01000
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (27) and the bitmask.
```
   11011  (Number: 27)
 & 01000  (Bitmask)
---------
   01000  (Result: 8)
```

In this example, the 4th bit of the number (11011) is set (equals 1). When ANDing it with the bitmask (0001000), the result is non-zero (8 in decimal). Hence, we can conclude that the 4th bit is set in the number.

Similarly, if the result of the AND operation is 0, it indicates that the specific bit is not set in the number.

**Test Question:**

1. Check if the 3rd bit (0-based index) of the number 42 (101010 in binary) is set.

Try to answer this test question using the AND operator and the concepts described above. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!


## AND is used for Extracting Bits
To extract a group of bits from an integer, you can use the AND operator along with a bitmask that isolates the specific bits you want to extract. By performing the AND operation with the bitmask, you retain only the bits that correspond to 1s in the mask, while setting all other bits to 0.

The key to extracting specific bits is to create a bitmask that represents the desired bit pattern. The bitmask should have 1s at the positions you want to extract and 0s at all other positions.

Here's how you can do it:

Apologies for the confusion in my response. You are absolutely right, and I made a mistake in providing the bitmask for the example. The bitmask should indeed have 1s at the positions you want to preserve (bits 2 to 4) and 0s elsewhere.

Let me correct that and provide the correct bitmask:

**Example: Extract bits 2 to 4 (inclusive) from the number 57 (111001 in binary).**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with 1s at the positions 2 to 4 and 0s elsewhere.
```
Bitmask:   001110
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (57) and the bitmask.
```
   111001  (Number: 57)
 & 001110 (Bitmask)
---------
   001000 (Result: 8)
```

**Test Question:**

1. Extract bits 1 to 3 (inclusive) from the number 92 (1011100 in binary).

## AND is used for checking for odd and even numbers
In binary representation, the least significant bit (LSB) is the rightmost bit, and it represents the value of 2^0 (which is 1). For any binary number, if the LSB is 0, the number is even, and if the LSB is 1, the number is odd.

You can use the AND operator with a bitmask that has only the LSB set to 1 (binary: 00000001) to check whether a number is odd or even.

Here's how you can do it:

**Example: Check if the number 42 is even or odd.**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with only the LSB set to 1 (binary: 00000001).
```
Bitmask:   000001
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (42) and the bitmask.
```
   101010  (Number: 42)
 & 000001 (Bitmask)
---------
   000000 (Result: 0)
```

In this example, the LSB of the number 42 is 0. When ANDing it with the bitmask (00000001), the result is 0, indicating that the number is even.

**Test Question:**

1. Check if the number 57 is even or odd.


## AND operator is used for masking
**Masking:**
Masking is a technique in which you use a bitmask to preserve or extract specific bits from an integer while clearing (setting to 0) or ignoring other bits.

When you want to preserve specific bits and set the rest to 0, you perform a bitwise AND operation with a bitmask that has 1s at the positions you want to keep and 0s everywhere else.

On the other hand, when you want to extract specific bits and set the rest to 0, you perform a bitwise AND operation with a bitmask that has 1s at the positions you want to extract and 0s elsewhere.

Masking is useful in various scenarios, such as filtering out irrelevant information, isolating specific data, or setting certain bits to known values.

Here are a couple of examples:

**Example 1: Preserve only the last 4 bits of the number 248 (11111000 in binary).**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with 1s at the positions you want to keep (last 4 bits).
```
Bitmask:   00001111
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (248) and the bitmask.
```
   11111000  (Number: 248)
 & 00001111  (Bitmask)
---------
   00001000  (Result: 8)
```

In this example, we preserve only the last 4 bits of the number 248 (11111000), which results in the number 8.

**Example 2: Extract bits 2 to 5 (inclusive) from the number 125 (01111101 in binary).**

Step 1: Create a bitmask with 1s at the positions you want to extract (bits 2 to 5).
```
Bitmask:   00111100
```

Step 2: Perform the bitwise AND operation between the number (125) and the bitmask.
```
   01111101  (Number: 125)
 & 00111100  (Bitmask)
---------
   00111100  (Result: 60)
```

In this example, we extract bits 2 to 5 from the number 125 (01111101), which results in the number 60.

**Test Question:**

1. Given the number 78 (binary: 1001110), create a bitmask that preserves only the 6th bit and sets all other bits to 0. Then, apply the bitmask to the number and find the resulting value.


## AND is used to filter oprions and flags
Certainly! Filtering options and flags using bitwise operations is a common use case for bit manipulation.

**Filtering Options and Flags:**
In programming, flags and options are often represented using individual bits in an integer. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific option or flag. To set a flag, you use the OR operator, and to check the status of a flag, you use the AND operator.

Here's how it works:

**Example: Using Flags to Represent Options**

Let's say you have the following options:

1. Option A: 0001 (binary) - Represented as 1 in decimal.
2. Option B: 0010 (binary) - Represented as 2 in decimal.
3. Option C: 0100 (binary) - Represented as 4 in decimal.
4. Option D: 1000 (binary) - Represented as 8 in decimal.

To enable multiple options simultaneously, you can use the OR operator to combine the flags. For example, enabling options A and C would result in:

```
0001 (Option A) | 0100 (Option C) = 0101 (binary) = 5 (decimal)
```

To check if a specific option is set, you use the AND operator with the corresponding bitmask. For example, to check if option B is enabled in the combined flags:

```
0101 (Combined flags) & 0010 (Option B) = 0000 (binary) = 0 (decimal)
```

Since the result is 0, we can determine that option B is not set.

**Test Question:**

1. Suppose you have the following options:
   - Option X: 0001 (binary) - Represented as 1 in decimal.
   - Option Y: 0010 (binary) - Represented as 2 in decimal.
   - Option Z: 0100 (binary) - Represented as 4 in decimal.

   Create a variable that represents a combination of options X and Z. Then, check if option Y is enabled.
