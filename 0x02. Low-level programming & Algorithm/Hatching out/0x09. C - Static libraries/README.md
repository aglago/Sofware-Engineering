## Summary
C libraries are collections of pre-made code that offer additional functionality to C programs. They come with header files that provide information about the available functions. Libraries can be static or dynamic, and programmers include them in their programs during the compilation process. Using libraries saves time and effort by utilizing existing code and making it easier to perform common tasks.
