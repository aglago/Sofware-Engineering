# Arithmetic Operations in C
+ `+` : Adds 2 operands
+ `-` : Subtracts second operand from first
+ `*` : Multiplies both operands
+ `/` : Divides numerator by denominator
+ `%` : Finds remainder of integer division
+ `++` : Increass integer value by 1
+ `--` : Decreases integer value by one

## Basic If Syntax
```c
    if ( statement is TRUE )
    Execute this line of code
```

  
## Basic Else syntax
```c
    if ( TRUE ) {
        /* Execute these statements if TRUE */
}
    else {
        /* Execute these statements if FALSE */
}
```


## Basic Else if 
```c
#include <stdio.h>    
 
int main() /* Most important part of the program!  */
{
    int age; /* Need a variable... */
   
    printf( "Please enter your age: " );  /* Asks for age */
    scanf( "%d", &age );                 /* The input is put in age */
    if ( age < 100 ) {                  /* If the age is less than 100 */
        printf ("You are pretty young!\n" ); /* Just to show you it works... */
    }
    else if ( age == 100 ) {            /* I use else just to show an example */ 
        printf( "You are old\n" );       
    }
    else {
        printf( "You are really old\n" );     /* Executed if no other statement is */
    }
  return 0;
 
}
```

# Boolean operators
+ 


# Relational operators
+ `>` : greater that
+ `<` : less than
+ `>=` : greater than or equal to
+ `<=` : less than or equal to
+ `==` : exactly equal to
+ `!=` : not equal to

# Logical operators
+ `&&` (Logical AND) : returns true when both conditions are true
+ `||` (Logical OR) : returns true when at least one condition is true
+ `!` (Logical NOT) : reverses the state of operand


# While Loops
+ loops are used when you want to do something not once but a few times over.

## Syntax
```c
    while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}
```

+ statement will continue to execute as long as condition is true.
