## The framework 
This framework provided outlines a step-by-step process for problem-solving and seeking help as a software engineer. Here is a summary of the framework:

+ Read: Gather all relevant information and understand the problem or project requirements thoroughly.
+ Think: Take time to think and break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. Develop a solution or algorithm before starting to code.
+ Ask why?: Understand the concepts, tools, and vocabulary related to the problem. Question their importance and how they fit into the larger context of computer science.
+ Read the error messages: When encountering errors, carefully read and understand the error messages provided by the compiler or runtime.
+ Google: Use search engines to find specific answers or understand concepts. Verify the information and never blindly trust the internet.
+ Google again: If the initial search doesn't yield results, try refining the search query or rephrasing the question.
+ Ask a peer: If still stuck, reach out to peers for help. Articulate the problem clearly, provide context, and explain the steps you have already taken.
+ Ask more peers: If peers couldn't provide a solution, seek assistance from other students, preferably from different cohorts or locations.
+ Ask ChatGPT: If previous steps didn't help, engage in a conversation with ChatGPT, an AI language model trained to provide intelligent responses and guidance. Ask for explanations, clarifications, or hints to understand concepts or find bugs.
+ Ask your Technical Mentors (TMs): Consult your dedicated Technical Mentor for guidance and support. Ensure you have followed the framework steps before seeking TM assistance.
+ Ask other TMs: If your TM is unavailable or unable to assist, approach TMs from other cohorts for help.
+ Ask Staff/Alumni/Mentors: If no previous steps resolved the issue, ask the staff for support. Clearly communicate specific and actionable questions that couldn't be resolved with the previous steps. Seek recommendations for alumni or mentors who can provide answers or advice.

Remember that understanding and learning are more important than achieving high scores. The goal is to become a skilled software engineer, and seeking help is an essential part of the learning process.
