## Project Overview
In addition to getting your technical tools set up, there’s another tool that’s critical to your success in this programme: growth mindset. Today, you’ll start to better understand what it is and what it isn’t– and you’ll start to practice using it. First stop is a TED talk by Stanford University professor, Carol Dweck.

## Project

## Summary
Today, we delved into various aspects of Python development, starting with the fundamentals of unit testing and the importance of test coverage for robust code validation. We explored the concepts of mocking and stubbing as techniques to isolate code during testing. Test-Driven Development (TDD) was introduced as a methodology where tests precede code implementation, promoting early bug detection and improved code design. Additionally, we covered practical aspects such as writing and reading JSON files using the `json` module. Lastly, we discussed the flexibility provided by `*args` and `**kwargs` in function parameters, allowing for the handling of variable numbers of positional and keyword arguments. This comprehensive overview provides a foundation for effective Python development, emphasizing testing practices and code organization.
