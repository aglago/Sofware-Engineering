## Summary
Shell navigation involves using commands like `cd` to change directories, `ls` to list files and directories, and `pwd` to display the current directory. You can move between directories using absolute or relative paths. With commands like `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`, you can create, copy, move, and remove files. Similarly, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `rm -r` allow you to create and remove directories. The `/tmp` directory is commonly used for temporary files. Practicing these commands will help you navigate the shell and manage files and directories effectively.
